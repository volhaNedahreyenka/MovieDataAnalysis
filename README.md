by Volha Nedahreyenka

Dataset
The name of the dataset is movie. This dataset includes data about directors, number of reviews, duration of the movie, number of likes on Facebook for directors and actors, genres, gross income, language, budget, country, IMDB score. I have gotten the data from kaggle.com. 

Summary of Findings
In the course of analysis I found out that Leonardo DiCaprio's six most successful movies according to their IMDB score were The Inception, The Departed, Django Unchained, The Wolf of Wall Street, Catch Me If You Can and Shutter Island. I also took a look into Martin Scorsese's movies. According to their financial return, the most successful movies at the time were The Color of Money, Cape Fear and Goodfellas. According to the data, the most liked actors on Facebook were Johhny Depp, Robin Williams and Robert De Niro. Another finding that I was able to make is that the majority of the movies in the dataset have their IMDB score between 6 and 7.
